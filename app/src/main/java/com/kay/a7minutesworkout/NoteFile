DISPLAYING THE RECYCLER VIEW.
(1) CREATE AN ADAPTER OBJECT (global variable) set it to null.
-> now we can use this adapter to assign it to our RecyclerView as an adapter.

(2) Create a new function that will display the recyclerview to the bottom.
-> find the recyclerview and bind it and set the "layoutManager" to "LinearLayoutManager()"
-> we can now put the parameters. (this, LinearLayoutManager.Horizontal, false)

(3) use the exerciseAdapter object that we create and assign the ExerciseStatusAdapter() to it, which is the adapter class we have created.
-> passed in the exerciseList to the adapter, and force it to be not null (unwrapped it)

(4) now assign the adapter to the recycler view.
-> call the function from onCreate.
(You can run and test now)

(5) You might need to center it in XML.
